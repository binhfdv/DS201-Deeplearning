## Data source

* <a href="https://github.com/duyvuleo/VNTC" target="_blank">A Large-scale Vietnamese News Text Classification Corpus</a>
* This dataset was used in the following paper:

`A Comparative Study on Vietnamese Text Classification Methods
Cong Duy Vu Hoang, Dien Dinh, Le Nguyen Nguyen, Quoc Hung Ngo. In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Research, Innovation and Vision for the Future (RIVF 2007) (long), 2007.
`

## Data preprocessing

* The source data is split into single sentences giving a dataset of 500,000 data points.

## Code

* Feature extraction and models training (and so on) in this repo are implemented in Google Colab.
* All codes are organized in `name.ipynb` files.
